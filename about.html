		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>
			Jack Forey Jr was born in San Antonio, Texas, to Jack Forey Sr and
			Maria Saenz-Forey in December 1934. He was the youngest of ten siblings
			(seven brothers and two sisters), and spent his early youth and adolescence
			working either in the cotton fields of rural Texas or in his father's auto
			shop. He went to school throughout the 1940s, but would drop out of
			high school and join the military. He would never see deployment on
			an active battlefield, but would travel across the US both for his
			basic training and to help train new recruits as he climbed the military
			ranks.
		</p>
		<p>
			In his free time, Jack's biggest hobby was golf. Whenever he could
			get away from work, he would travel around the United States and play
			golf in many different states and environments - from New York to New
			Mexico. He would play in some local unprofessional golf tournaments, and
			reportedly did very well. He was also a devout Catholic, like his parents,
			and frequently donated his time or income to various religious charities.
			Finally, he claims to have met Elvis Presley when the singer did his
			training in Texas, and was a fan of his music both at the time and in
			the present day.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually, Jack would go to become the manager of his base's commissary -
			a military grocery store that sells items to military service members and
			their families. It's here where he proved himself to be a highly capable
			boss, and he would stay in this position for the rest of his military career.
			It's here he would also meet secretary Viva Steffens, who he would later
			marry in 1973 and then have their only child, Jack Forey III. His family
			would eventually end up living in Bellevue, NE so Jack could work at
			Offutt Air Force Base (AFB). He would work there for almost 20 years
			before eventually retiring in 1996.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the present day, Jack is almost 90 years old.
			He currently has two grandchildren, Jack Forey IV and Truman Forey
			(myself), and one great-grandchild through Jack IV, Nathan Forey.
			He remains in good health, and spends his time staying in shape so
			he can keep playing golf in his old age.

		<h2>Interview Questions</h2>
		<p>
			In order to build this website, I interviewed Jack in order to learn more
			about him. Here are the responses he had to some questions I asked:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				How was your relationship with your parents?
				<ul>
					<li>
						Oh I love them. They weren''t the nicest folk sometimes,
						but they were doing good with what little we had. Made me work,
						but we all needed to work to survive.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				You always mention that you worked in the cotton fields when you
				were younger – I imagine you didn’t like doing that?
				<ul>
					<li>
						No, but it was honest work. Back-breaking. Plus it was
						family work, everyone had to do it. It kept food on the table.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				And what about your brothers and sisters? I know you love them too,
				but do you have any stories about them?
				<ul>
					<li>
						A bunch, but I won''t get too much into it. Once we joined
						the military, we all went our ways and didn't get together
						a lot. I miss them though. I miss them a lot.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Why did you join the military?
				<ul>
					<li>
						Well it's just what you did, it's what we did. You
						<em>(me, his grandson)</em> are going to school and I'm proud of
						you for that, but we didn't have that option. If you
						couldn't get a scholarship to go to school,
						you joined the military.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				So how was being in the military?
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ehh. I didn't like training, but I liked being around
						the culture. It wasn't anything special to me, it was
						just a job.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				What else did you do when you were younger?
				<ul>
					<li>
						Well I was young and I was stupid. I had money,
						I had girls, I smoked and drank. But that stuff
						catches up with you. I was never addicted to
						anything, thank God for that, but it's not
						good for you.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				What place in the US did you enjoy visiting the most?
				<ul>
					<li>
						I'd have to say New Mexico. Loved the culture, loved
						the weather, loved the golf course there. But I don't
						think I would want to live there. Too expensive.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				So you moved to Nebraska from Texas – do you like it here?
				<ul>
					<li>
						It's good, you know I hate when it gets cold. But it's
						beautiful and I love it here. And the sunsets are the
						best there are in the United States.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				How was it to work in the Commissary?
				<ul>
					<li>
						It was alright. I liked being in charge, but
						dealing with customers and employees was always a
						hassle. Always someone with a problem. But I
						learned a lot, and I liked helping people
						when I could.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally, is there any advice you would give to anyone you meet?
				<ul>
					<li>
						My father told me once, "I believe in the law of divine
						compensation. Everyone will get what they deserve in
						the end." I've always believed that too.
						<br><br>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
