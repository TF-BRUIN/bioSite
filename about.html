		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>
			Jack Forey Jr was born in San Antonio, Texas, to Jack Forey Sr and
			Maria Saenz-Forey in December 1934. He was the youngest of ten siblings
			(seven brothers and two sisters), and spent his early youth and adolescence
			working either in the cotton fields of rural Texas or in his father’s auto
			shop. He went to school throughout the 1940s, but would drop out of
			high school and join the military. He would never see deployment on
			an active battlefield, but would travel across the US both for his
			basic training and to help train new recruits as he climbed the military
			ranks.

		<p>
			In his free time, Jack’s biggest hobby was golf. Whenever he could
			get away from work, he would travel around the United States and play
			golf in many different states and environments – from New York to New
			Mexico. He would play in some local unprofessional golf tournaments, and
			reportedly did very well. He was also a devout Catholic, like his parents,
			and frequently donated his time or income to various religious charities.
			Finally, he claims to have met Elvis Presley when the singer did his
			training in Texas, and was a fan of his music both at the time and in
			the present day.

			Eventually, Jack would go to become the manager of his base’s commissary –
			a military grocery store that sells items to military service members and
			their families. It’s here where he proved himself to be a highly capable
			boss, and he would stay in this position for the rest of his military career.
			It’s here he would also meet secretary Viva Steffens, who he would later
			marry in 1973 and then have their only child, Jack Forey III. His family
			would eventually end up living in Bellevue, NE so Jack could work at
			Offutt Air Force Base (AFB). He would work there for almost 20 years
			before eventually retiring in 1996.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the present day, Jack is almost 90 years old.
			He currently has two grandchildren, Jack Forey IV and Truman Forey
			(myself), and one great-grandchild through Jack IV, Nathan Forey.
			He remains in good health, and spends his time staying in shape so
			he can keep playing golf in his old age.
