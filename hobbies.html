					Jack's favorite sport has always been golf. The reason
					it's his favorite is because he enjoys being outside and
					enjoying the weather without getting too tired. He
					traveled across the country to play the sport while
					he was in the military.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jack's parents - Jack Sr and Maria Saenz - were both raised
					Catholic, and taught their children to be  devoted Christians
					themselves. Jack regularly goes to church on Sunday, and has
					frequently donated time, money, and clothes to various
					charities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jack was a fan of Elvis Presley's music ever since he first
					heard it in the 50s. Miraculously, he even met the King
					when Presley did miiltary service - during his training in
					Texas. Jack is still a fan of Presley's music today.
