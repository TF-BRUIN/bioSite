			<div class="short_bio">
				Jack Forey (age 90) is a former member of the military. Born in San Antonio,
				Texas, he enlisted in the military at the age of 18 and served for his entire life. 
				He would travel the United States while in training, enjoying the sights and
				playing Golf (his favorite sports) all over the country. He met his wife Viva 
				while he was stationed in Florida, and then moved to Bellevue, Nebraska to 
				become the permanent manager of the Offutt AFB commissary. He retired in 1996 
				and continued to live in Bellevue, enjoying his retirement with his son, grandson, 
				and local family and friends.

			<div class="left-accomplishment">
				Jack Forey has traveled across the United States of 
				America, both as a part of his job and in pursuit of 
				his greatest hobby - playing Golf. Being able to see 
				so much of the nation and play in a wide variety of 
				different courses is a huge achievement in his life.
			</div>
			<div class="right-accomplishment">
				For most of his working life, Jack was the manager of 
				the Offutt Air Force Base comissary. He worked closely 
				with his fellow soldiers and their families in order 
				to keep them happy and healthy, and took a lot of 
				pride in helping people.

			<div class="left-accomplishment">
				In his older age, Jack has put in a lot of effort to 
				keep himself active and healthy. While he's still 
				experienced a lot of the effects of aging - including 
				defeating a mild form of leukemia - he is rightfully 
				proud of how active he still is at the age of 90.
